## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
This a basic appointment manager application, where users are able to create, update and delete appointments. Users are also able to create referrals to other institutions.

Through the development of this task, I have learnt about:
- design and implemention of an application through the MVC pattern;
- became familiar with software design as I created use case, class and sequence diagrams to help to understand the architecture of the application;
- understand the concept of OOP modularization;
- understand the practical aspects of an implementation of a project such as to created a virtual environment, amongst others;
- learnt about linting;
- reinforce the importance and becoming familiar with pep 8 guidelines;
- learnt mock testing.
